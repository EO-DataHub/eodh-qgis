# eodh-qgis Plugin

A QGIS plugin to integrate with the Earth Observation Data Hub (EODH)
This plugin demonstrates the EO Application Package and workflow capabilities of the EODH.

## Development

### Requirements

Install pyeodh library to `libs/<os>` (os: `linux`, `darwin` or `windows`).

To e.g. install/update to latest version from pypi: `pip install --target libs/linux --upgrade pyeodh`

### Flatpak and VSCode

To setup language server support in VSCode if you've installed QGIS from Flatpak:

1. Find pyqgis location

   ` find / -type d -wholename "*share/qgis/python/qgis" 2> /dev/null`

2. Set the `PYTHONPATH` env variable for VSCode by creating a `.env` file with the following content:

   `PYTHONPATH="/path/to/pyqgis"`

3. Restart VSCode

### Developer workflow

1. Make changes
2. Deploy changes to plugin directory

   1. Locate the QGIS plugin directory, **make sure the directory named after the plugin is included in the path** e.g. `~/.var/app/org.qgis.qgis/data/QGIS/QGIS3/profiles/default/python/plugins/eodh_qgis`
   2. (Optional) Set this path as an env variable in `.env` named `EODH_QGIS_PATH`
   3. Run `python deploy.py <path to plugin directory>` (Path can be ommited if already set as an env variable in prev. step)

3. Reload plugin
